This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML involving incorrect event listener assignment in JavaScript.  The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, where an event listener is added twice using different methods (direct assignment and `addEventListener`). This leads to unpredictable execution, potentially overriding the intended functionality. The solution, in `bugSolution.html`, demonstrates the correct way to add event listeners to avoid this issue.
